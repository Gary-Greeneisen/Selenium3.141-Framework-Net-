What is implicit wait?
Implicit wait is a type of wait, which puts a wait time between the execution of two steps. 
The default wait time between two steps is zero.
Implicit wait allows the web driver to wait for the completion of a step or loading of an an element.

An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element 
or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0. Once set, the implicit wait is set 
for the life of the WebDriver object instance.


What is Explicit Wait?
An explicit wait is a code that you define to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in 
the code. WebDriverWait by default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully.

Explicit wait is a type of wait (applied through code piece), which is used to stop the execution till a 
specific condition is true.
We use WebDriverWait and ExpectedCondition classes of Selenium web driver to implement explicit wait.


//Explict waits syntax
 WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
IWebElement myDynamicElement = wait.Until<IWebElement>(d => d.FindElement(By.Id("someDynamicElement")));

This waits up to 10 seconds before throwing a TimeoutException or if it finds the element will return it 
in 0 - 10 seconds. WebDriverWait by default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it returns 
successfully. A successful return value for the ExpectedCondition function type is a Boolean value of true, or 
a non-null object.

//Implicit waits syntax
driver.Manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
WebElement myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id("myDynamicElement"));

An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to 
find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0. Once set, 
the implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object instance.
